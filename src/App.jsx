            Happy Birthday, Jessi! ðŸŽ‰ Time flies, but with you, it feels
            like weâ€™ve been friends forever. We met back in 2021, but honestly,
            itâ€™s always felt like weâ€™ve known each other for a lifetime. From
            our first conversation to all the countless memories weâ€™ve created,
            every moment has been a blessing. You have this incredible ability
            to light up a room with your smile and make everyone feel at ease.
            Youâ€™ve been my cheerleader, my secret keeper, and the person who
            understands me even without words. I admire your strength, kindness,
            and the way you always find beauty in the little things. On your
            special day, I just want to say how grateful I am to have you in my
            life. May this year bring you as much joy, laughter, and love as
            youâ€™ve brought into mine. You deserve all the happiness in the world
            and then some. Hereâ€™s to celebrating you todayâ€”your awesomeness,
            your dreams, and all the amazing things yet to come. Letâ€™s make it a
            day to remember! Cheers to many more years of friendship and
            adventures! <br /> ðŸ¥‚ðŸ’– With all my love !!
